# DiaKEM LibreLinkUp Api Client

Fetch cgm data of FreeStyle Libre 2/3 directly from abbot's sharing service.

## Description

This client allows you to connect to abbot's sharing server which is also used by its application **LibreLinkUp**.

If you plan to implement your own client or are interested in the sharing api you can find detailed
information here: https://gist.github.com/khskekec/6c13ba01b10d3018d816706a32ae8ab2

## Installation

Simply install the package via your favorite package manager:
```
npm i @diakem/libre-link-up-api-client
```

## Usage

The client only needs your *LibreLinkUp* credentials to connect to the sharing service and retrieve
cgm data. You do not need to take care of login - the client will handle the initial login and
also do it if your session expires.

### read()
```javascript
import {LibreLinkUpClient} from '@diakem/libre-link-up-api-client';

const {read} = LibreLinkUpClient({username: 'myLibreLinkUpEmailAddress', password: 'pAssw0rd!'});

const response = await read();
```

You will get the following data structure:

```typescript
export type LibreCgmData = {
  value: number,
  isHigh: boolean,
  isLow: boolean,
  trend: TrendType,
  date: Date
}
```

### readRaw()
You have also the possibility to retrieve the raw response returned by the sharing service:

```javascript
import {LibreLinkUpClient} from '@diakem/libre-link-up-api-client';

const {readRaw} = LibreLinkUpClient({username: 'myLibreLinkUpEmailAddress', password: 'pAssw0rd!'});

const response = await readRaw();
```

You will get the following data structure:

```typescript
type ReadRawResponse = {
  connection: Connection,
  activeSensors: ActiveSensor[],
  graphData: GlucoseItem[]
};
```

### readAveraged()

Get average data.

* `amount: number`: Amount of data which should be collected before calculating the average
* `callback: function`: Callback function which will be invoked if `amount` of data was collected and average can be calculated
* `interval: number (DEFAULT: 15 seconds)`: Milliseconds between each call to the service

```javascript
import {LibreLinkUpClient} from '@diakem/libre-link-up-api-client';

const {readAveraged} = LibreLinkUpClient({username: 'myLibreLinkUpEmailAddress', password: 'pAssw0rd!'});

const callback = (average, memory) => {
  console.log({
      average,
      memory
  });  
};

const response = await readAveraged(5, callback, 15000);
```

The callback method will receive the following parameters:

```typescript
// Average dataset
average: LibreCgmData,
// All cgm data which was used to calculate average data
memory: LibreCgmData[]
// All historical readings available at the sharing service
history: LibreCgmData[]
```
